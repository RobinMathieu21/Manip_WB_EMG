# MANIP WB EMG



## Introduction

This project contains all the codes used for the post-processing of the data.
It contains several codes that call others, the codes to be run are :
**Kinematics:**
- Run_EMGravity_WHOLE_BOdy_STS_BTS_1_kinematics.m : First script to be runned to check the kinematic data of *Whole-body tasks* and recut if necessary
- Run_EMGravity_WHOLE_BOdy_STS_BTS_1_kinematics_tous.m : Second script to be runned on data presviously processed by the code above, to compute main kinematics parameters
